# Machine Learning

### What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning uses a variety of algorithms that iteratively learn from data to improve, describe data, and predict outcomes.
Machine learning is a form of AI that enables a system to learn from data rather than through explicit programming.

### Why do we use Machine Learning?
With the ever increasing amounts of data becoming available there is good reason to
believe that smart data analysis will become even more pervasive as a necessary ingredient for technological progress.


### When not to use Machine Learning?

### Uses of Machine Learning


### Big Data
Big data is any kind of data source that has at least one of four shared characteristics,
called the four Vs:
» Extremely large Volumes of data » The ability to move that data at a high Velocity of speed » An ever-expanding Variety of data sources » Veracity so that data sources truly represent truth The accuracy of a machine learning model can increase substantially if it’s trained on big data.

### Data mining
Data mining, which is based on the principles of statistics, is the process of exploring and analyzing large amounts of data to discover patterns in that data. Algorithms are used to find relationships and patterns in the data, and then this information about the patterns is used to make forecasts and predictions.
Generally, the goal of the data mining is to extract data from a larger data set for the purposes of classification or prediction. In data mining, data is clustered into groups.

### Hybrid Cloud
To deepen learning, a company may, for example, want to leverage Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) on the cloud rather than building their own GPU-based environment. This is a hybrid approach.
A hybrid cloud is a combination of on-premises and public cloud services intended to work in unison.

### Descriptive Analytics
Descriptive analytics helps the analysts understand current reality in the business. You need to understand the context for historical data in order to understand the current reality of where the business is today.

### Predictive Analytics
Predictive analytics helps anticipate changes based on understanding the patterns and anomalies within the data. With this model, the analyst assimilates a number of related data sources in order to predict outcomes. A predictive analytics tool requires that the model is constantly provided with new data that reflects business change.

### Statistics
Statistics is the science of analyzing data. Classical or conventional statistics in inferential in nature, meaning it is used to reach conclusions about the data (various parameters). Statistical modeling is focused primarily on making inferences and understanding the characteristics of the variables. Machine learning models leverage statistical algorithms and apply them to predict analytics. In a statistical model, a hypothesis is a testable way to confirm the validity of the specific algorithm.

### Machine Learning Types
  #### Supervised
  Supervised learning typically begins with an established set of data and a certain understanding of how that data is classified. 
Supervised learning is intended to find patterns in data that can be applied to an analytics process. When the label is continuous, it is a regression; when the data comes from a finite set of values, it known as classification. In essence, regression used for supervised learning helps you understand the correlation between variables.

  ### Unsupervised
  Unsupervised learning is best suited when the problem requires a massive amount of data that is unlabeled. For example, social media applications, such as Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat. Unsupervised learning algorithms segment data into groups of examples (clusters) or groups of features. The unlabeled data creates the parameter values and classification of the data. In essence, this process adds labels to the data so that it becomes supervised.

### Deep Learning
Deep learning is a specific method of machine learning that incorporates neural networks in successive layers in order to learn from data in an iterative manner. Deep learning is especially use￾ful when you’re trying to learn patterns from unstructured data. Deep learning  — complex neural networks  — are designed to 
emulate how the human brain works so computers can be trained to deal with abstractions and problems that are poorly defined.  Neural network consists of three or more layers: an input layer, one or many hidden layers, and an output layer. 

### Transfer learning
Transfer learning is when you take the information an existing machine learning model has learned and adjust it to your own problem. Training a machine learning model from scratch can be expensive and time-consuming.

### Business intelligence analysis

One of the traps that company leadership falls into is its assumptions and biases. Too often company management looks at the data presented and interprets the results through its own lens. Is the business sustainable in light of emerging competitors with unforeseen business models? While it is easy to be caught unaware of change, the seeds of change exist. However, those leading indicators are often buried inside huge amounts of unstructured or
semi structured data.

### Generalization 
The ability for machine learning model to perform well on data it hasn’t seen before

### Types of Data:
- #### Structured Data
  - Think a table of rows and columns, an Excel spreadsheet of customer transactions, a database of patient records. Columns can be numerical, such as average heart rate, categorical, such as sex, or ordinal, such as chest pain intensity

- #### Unstructured
  - Anything not immediately able to be put into row and column format, images, audio files, natural language text

- #### Static data
  - Existing historical data which is unlikely to change. Your companies customer purchase history is a good example

- #### Streaming data
  - Data which is constantly updated, older records may be changed, newer records are constantly being added.


### Classification Terms:
- #### False Negatives
  - Model predicts negative, actually positive. In some cases, like email spam prediction, false negatives aren’t too much to worry about. But if a self-driving cars computer vision system predicts no pedestrian when there was one, this is not good.

- #### False Positive
  - Model predicts positive, actually negative. Predicting someone has heart disease when they don’t, might seem okay. Better to be safe right? Not if it negatively affects the person’s lifestyle or sets them on a treatment plan they don’t need.

- #### True Negatives
  - Model predicts negative, actually negative. This is good.

- #### True Positive
  - Model predicts positive, actually positive. This is good.

- #### Precision
  - What proportion of positive predictions were actually correct? A model that produces no false positives has a precision of 1.0.

- #### Recall
  - What proportion of actual positives were predicted correctly? A model that produces no false negatives has a recall of 1.0.

- #### F1 Score
  - A combination of precision and recall. The closer to 1.0, the better.

- #### Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) & Area under the curve (AUC)
  - The ROC curve is a plot comparing true positive and false positive rate. The AUC metric is the area under the ROC curve. A model whose predictions are 100% wrong has an AUC of 0.0, one whose predictions are 100% right has an AUC of 1.0.

### Regression Terms:
- #### Mean absolute error (MAE)
  - The average difference between your model's predictions and the actual numbers.

- #### Root mean square error (RMSE)
  - The square root of the average of squared differences between your model's predictions and the actual numbers.

### Precision @ k
- Same as regular precision, however, you choose the cutoff, k. For example, precision at 5, means we only care about the top 5 recommendations. You may have 10,000 products. But you can’t recommend them all to your customers.
