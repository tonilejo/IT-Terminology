### What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning uses a variety of algorithms that iteratively learn from data to improve, describe data, and predict outcomes.
Machine learning is a form of AI that enables a system to learn from data rather than through explicit programming.

### Why do we use Machine Learning?
With the ever increasing amounts of data becoming available there is good reason to
believe that smart data analysis will become even more pervasive as a necessary ingredient for technological progress.


### When not to use Machine Learning?

### Big Data

Big data is any kind of data source that has at least one of four shared characteristics,
called the four Vs:
» Extremely large Volumes of data » The ability to move that data at a high Velocity of speed » An ever-expanding Variety of data sources » Veracity so that data sources truly represent truth The accuracy of a machine learning model can increase substantially if it’s trained on big data.
