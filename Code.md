## Variable Naming Conventions

### Snake case
- Snake case uses an underscore between words to create separation. Variable names cannot contain spaces, which reduces readability when multiple words must be used to describe a variable's purpose. The underscore in a snake-cased variable tries to minimize this shortcoming.
- this_is_snake_case

### Camel case
- When multiple words are used to form a variable, camel case joins those words together, without any white space, and delineates the start of each new word with a capital letter. Words are delimited by capital letters, except the initial word.
- thisIsCamelCase

### Pascal Case
- Words are delimited by capital letters.

### Hungarian Notation
- This notation describes the variable type or purpose at the start of the variable name, followed by a descriptor that indicates the variable’s function. The Camelcase notation is used to delimit words.
- arrDistrubuteGroup  #Array called “Distribute Group”


### IDE
An integrated development environment (IDE) is software for building applications that combines common developer tools into a single graphical user interface (GUI). An IDE typically consists of:

- **Source code editor**: A text editor that can assist in writing software code with features such as syntax highlighting with visual cues, providing language specific auto-completion, and checking for bugs as code is being written.

- **Local build automation**: Utilities that automate simple, repeatable tasks as part of creating a local build of the software for use by the developer, like compiling computer source code into binary code, packaging binary code, and running automated tests.

- **Debugger**: A program for testing other programs that can graphically display the location of a bug in the original code.
