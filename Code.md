## Variable Naming Conventions

### Snake case
- Snake case uses an underscore between words to create separation. Variable names cannot contain spaces, which reduces readability when multiple words must be used to describe a variable's purpose. The underscore in a snake-cased variable tries to minimize this shortcoming.

- this_is_snake_case

### Camel case
- When multiple words are used to form a variable, camel case joins those words together, without any white space, and delineates the start of each new word with a capital letter. Words are delimited by capital letters, except the initial word.

- thisIsCamelCase

### Pascal Case
- Words are delimited by capital letters.

### Hungarian Notation
- This notation describes the variable type or purpose at the start of the variable name, followed by a descriptor that indicates the variable’s function. The Camelcase notation is used to delimit words.

- arrDistrubuteGroup  #Array called “Distribute Group”


### IDE
An integrated development environment (IDE) is software for building applications that combines common developer tools into a single graphical user interface (GUI). An IDE typically consists of:

- **Source code editor**: A text editor that can assist in writing software code with features such as syntax highlighting with visual cues, providing language specific auto-completion, and checking for bugs as code is being written.

- **Local build automation**: Utilities that automate simple, repeatable tasks as part of creating a local build of the software for use by the developer, like compiling computer source code into binary code, packaging binary code, and running automated tests.

- **Debugger**: A program for testing other programs that can graphically display the location of a bug in the original code.

### Object Oriented Programming
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.

 - OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. This approach to programming is well-suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained.

### Structure of Object Oriented Programming
The structure, or building blocks, of object-oriented programming include the following:

- **Classes** are user-defined data types that act as the blueprint for individual objects, attributes and methods.

- **Objects** are instances of a class created with specifically defined data. Objects can correspond to real-world objects or an abstract entity. When class is defined initially, the description is the only object that is defined.

- **Methods** are functions that are defined inside a class that describe the behaviors of an object. Each method contained in class definitions starts with a reference to an instance object. Additionally, the subroutines contained in an object are called instance methods. Programmers use methods for reusability or keeping functionality encapsulated inside one object at a time.

- **Attributes** are defined in the class template and represent the state of an object. Objects will have data stored in the attributes field. Class attributes belong to the class itself.

### Main Principles of Object Oriented Programming

- **Encapsulation** - This principle states that all important information is contained inside an object and only select information is exposed. The implementation and state of each object are privately held inside a defined class. Other objects do not have access to this class or the authority to make changes. They are only able to call a list of public functions or methods. This characteristic of data hiding provides greater program security and avoids unintended data corruption.

- **Abstraction** - Objects only reveal internal mechanisms that are relevant for the use of other objects, hiding any unnecessary implementation code. The derived class can have its functionality extended. This concept can help developers more easily make additional changes or additions over time.

- **Inheritance** - Classes can reuse code from other classes. Relationships and subclasses between objects can be assigned, enabling developers to reuse common logic while still maintaining a unique hierarchy. This property of OOP forces a more thorough data analysis, reduces development time and ensures a higher level of accuracy.

- **Polymorphism** - Objects are designed to share behaviors and they can take on more than one form. The program will determine which meaning or usage is necessary for each execution of that object from a parent class, reducing the need to duplicate code. A child class is then created, which extends the functionality of the parent class. Polymorphism allows different types of objects to pass through the same interface.

### Script
- In computer programming, a script is a program or sequence of instructions that is interpreted or carried out by another program rather than by the computer processor (as a compiled program is).

### Algorithm
- A programming algorithm is a procedure or formula used for solving a problem. It is based on conducting a sequence of specified actions in which these actions describe how to do something, and your computer will do it exactly that way every time.

### API
- API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. 

### Framework
- A programming framework is a prepackaged set of solutions that solves common development problems. Frameworks are used mainly to save time and to ensure best practices are followed.

### Library
- Libraries in programming languages are collections of prewritten code that users can use to optimize tasks.

### Variable
- In computer programming, a variable is an abstract storage location paired with an associated symbolic name, which contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a value; or in simpler terms, a variable is a container for a particular set of bits or type of data.

### Bug
- A software bug is an error, flaw or fault in a computer program or system that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways. The process of finding and fixing bugs is termed "**debugging**" and often uses formal techniques or tools to pinpoint bugs
