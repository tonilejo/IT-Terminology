## Variable Naming Conventions

### Snake case
- Snake case uses an underscore between words to create separation. Variable names cannot contain spaces, which reduces readability when multiple words must be used to describe a variable's purpose. The underscore in a snake-cased variable tries to minimize this shortcoming.
- this_is_snake_case

### Camel case
- When multiple words are used to form a variable, camel case joins those words together, without any white space, and delineates the start of each new word with a capital letter. Words are delimited by capital letters, except the initial word.
- thisIsCamelCase

### Pascal Case
- Words are delimited by capital letters.

### Hungarian Notation
- This notation describes the variable type or purpose at the start of the variable name, followed by a descriptor that indicates the variable’s function. The Camelcase notation is used to delimit words.
- arrDistrubuteGroup  #Array called “Distribute Group”
